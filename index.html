    The head is the next tag immediately after the html tag.
    It is in charge of holding metadata about the website, the title that

    external CSS styling (more on CSS later).

    If you have more than <head> tag, you are also doing something wrong.

      h1 is the main heading of a website. It is the largest type of heading.

      There are six layers of headings (i.e., <h1>, <h2>, ..., <h5>, <h6>).

      When you decide which heading you are using, you should think about
      what level of content is that heading in:
      - There should only ever be one h1 on your web page as it is the main heading.
      - Depending on how you structure your website, you may have only one h2 or you
        may have several.
          - If you want to use a subheading for your main heading, you will only have
            one h2 tag.
          - If your h2 tag serves more as a heading for a section of content, you will
            use h2 as the heading for each new section of content.

    <h4>Location</h4>
    <p>
      The story is set in a fictional area of rural Spain where a mysterious
      cult has begun to convert the people who live in the area into something
      other than human.

    <h4>Why is it a Remake?</h4>
    <p>
      Resident Evil 4 Remake is, at the time of writing, the most recent game in
      the Resident Evil series to receive the "remake" treatment with improved
      visuals, graphics, and gameplay based off the original Resident Evil 4
      game, which was released in 2005.

      This is an h3 because it is the start of a new section unrelated to the

      The a tag allows us to link to other web pages (i.e., other web files).

      href is the attribute used to state which web page you are linking to.

      target allows you to choose where the link opens. When we use _blank,
      it opens in a new tab on the web browser. This is a common thing to do
      when you are linking to an external website (i.e., a website that you
      do not own and is not part of your actual website).
