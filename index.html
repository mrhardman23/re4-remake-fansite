<!-- DOCTYPE defines this file as an HTML file. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
  The html tag is the tag that holds all content and metadata about the website.

  If you have more than one <html> tag, you are doing something wrong.

  lang has to be defined and is the language your website is written in.
-->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- 
    The head is the next tag immediately after the html tag.
    It is in charge of holding metadata about the website, the title that
    will be displayed in the tab of the web browser, favicon, and internal and 
    external CSS styling (more on CSS later).

    If you have more than <head> tag, you are also doing something wrong.
  -->
  <head>
    <!-- 
      This first meta tag talks about the encoding used to display
      characters on the website (i.e., UTF-8).

      This needs to be in the head. If you do not have it, you are wrong.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- 
      The second meta tag talks about the viewport (a.k.a. the window that the
      user is viewing the website in).

      This tag deals with how the website resizes when the window changes in size.

      This needs to be in the head. If you do not have it, you are wrong.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--
      NOTE: This commented line of code is how you add a favicon to your website.

      This is outside the scope of this class (i.e., you do not need to know how to
      do this.)
    -->
    <!-- <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/re4-remake-fav.png" /> -->

    <!-- 
      The title tag is the text that displays in the tab of a web browser.

      This should be included and should be descriptive of what the website is
      displaying.

      The default text is Document. DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE THAT TEXT!
      Try to change this text as the very first thing you do in your website.

    <title>Home | RE4 Remake Fan Website</title>
    <!-- 
    Make sure to remember to close your head tag.
    
    REMEMBER: None of the content you actually want displayed on your website
    should EVER go in the head. It all goes in the body!
  --></head>
  <!-- 
    The body tag immediately follows the head tag. It holds all the content
    that you want displayed on your website.

    There should only ever be one body tag! If you add another body tag, 
    you are wrong!
  -->
  <body>
    <!--
      h1 is the main heading of a website. It is the largest type of heading.

      There are six layers of headings (i.e., <h1>, <h2>, ..., <h5>, <h6>).

      When you decide which heading you are using, you should think about
      what level of content is that heading in:
      - There should only ever be one h1 on your web page as it is the main heading.
      - Depending on how you structure your website, you may have only one h2 or you
        may have several.
          - If you want to use a subheading for your main heading, you will only have
            one h2 tag.
          - If your h2 tag serves more as a heading for a section of content, you will
            use h2 as the heading for each new section of content.
